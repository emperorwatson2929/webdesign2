          <p class="lead"> Lush is Mitski's debut album. She released it on January 31, 2012 during her third year at Purchase College, but she began writing the songs at age 18. Despite the differing ages of the songs, there is an overarching theme of grappling with one's outer beauty versus inner desires. Mitski details her struggles with craving physical validation while simultaneously feeling hollow inside. Lush is one of Mitski's most instrumentally strong albums, and it features the piano more heavily than her other albums. </p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Liquid Smooth" is the title track of Lush. This song details the struggle for physical validation that many young women face at the hands of society. In this song, Mitski states that she is "in [her] prime" and she invites the listener to "come touch [her], too," which represents the idea that women are pressured to make the most of their younger years before they are not beautiful anymore.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Wife" is the second track of Lush. This song tells the story of an infertile wife who longs to bear a son for her husband. Mitski comments on the patriarchy by comparing a childless wife to a woman with no name. If the wife in this story is unable to bear a son, she loses her purpose. This evokes the patriarchal idea that women exist only to benefit their husbands and continue the cycle of the patriarchy by bearing only sons and no daughters.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Abbey" is the third track of Lush. In this song, Mitski discusses the feeling of living a stagnant, uneventful life while still longing for something more. She gives voice to a dream that "only appears in the dark of sleep" in order to compare her drive and ambition to her current lack of progress. An abbey is a religious building that mainly houses nuns. Mitski combines this religious connotation with echoey, haunting vocals that build a tension that eventually fades at the end of the song.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Brand New City" is the fourth track of Lush. In this song, Mitski continues to describe her desire to constantly achieve some sort of success while in reality, her life is uneventful. She envisions herself decaying with age as she exits the "prime" of her life without having done anything meaningful with it. The title refers to the phenomenon in which people feel as though moving to a new city will allow them to restart their lives and achieve more than they did before.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Eric" is the fifth track of Lush and it tells the story of an emotionally unfulfilling "friends-with-benefits" relationship. Mitski states that she craves a deeper emotional connection with this man, but she "knows the rules" of their relationship and is thus forbidden from attempting to be with him on that level. Mitski allows this man to hurt her because she wants him to accept her. She discusses selling all of herself to him for just a part of his love.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Bag of Bones" is the sixth track of Lush. This song describes another toxic relationship that Mitski finds herself in. This relationship is purely based on lust but it still emotionally drains her. She describes feelings of inadequacy and emptiness, equating herself to a "bag of bones." Mitski continues to struggle with confidence, describing her need for physical validation that stemmed from her teenage years.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Door" is the seventh track of Lush. The door refers to a part of Mitski's inner self that she has been unable to access/understand. This song uses dissonant tones and scratchiness to give the impression that Mitski is fighting through her mental state in order to find this figurative door. This song details Mitski's journey with self-discovery, and she arrives at a conclusion at the end of the song when she finds "a hopeless violence" that she names "love."</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Pearl Diver" is the penultimate track on Lush. A pearl diver, also called "Ama" in Japanese, is a woman who is trained to dive down and collect pearls with no scuba diving equipment. They are able to hold their breath for up to two minutes. Mitski references this Japanese tradition in this song in order to invoke the idea that she continues to dive deep into something she might not get out of, despite not being able to breathe.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>"Real Men" is the final track of Lush. In this song, Mitski discusses the toxic emphasis that society places on masculinity and what are defined as true masculine attributes. She mocks that "real men" do not have to eat, bleed, or fear. They just have to remain stoic and powerful. Mitski also comments on the effects that toxic masculinity has on women, stating that she only feels valued when a "real man" appreciates her beauty.</p>
