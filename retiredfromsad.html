			        			        Retired from Sad, New Career in Business is Mitski's second studio album. It was released on August 1, 2013 during her senior year at Purchase College. This album fits into a unique genre of indie rock that utilizes more traditional orchestral instruments such as violin and flute. Mitski's lyrics continue to be poetic and captivating, and although the experiences Mitski wrote about in this album are unique to herself, her vivid lyricism makes it feel as though the listener experienced them with her. She draws from the unspoken yet universal aspects of the female experience, such as comparing oneself to other women, in order to create her second masterful album.

                                <p>“Goodbye, My Danish Sweetheart” is the first track of <i>Retired From Sad</i> and this song is about falling for somebody who has moved on from you before you have realized your true feelings for them. Mitski states that her heart has “blossomed” for this person, and she wishes they would “spare [her their] voice if she called,” signifying that this person has moved on but Mitski still wishes they were together.</p>

                                <p>This song features heavy orchestral elements such as trombone, french horn, clarinet, and flute. These instruments accompany slow and melodic lyrics that discuss a relationship in which Mitski does not feel adequate. She hints towards starvation and other means of making herself seem more fit to play the part of this man’s girlfriend. At the end of the narrative, they part ways with a handshake, solidifying their relationship as merely acquaintances in the end.</p>

                                <p>This song is far more upbeat than all of the other songs on the album, creating a stark departure from the solemn narratives that the rest of the songs tell. In this song, Mitski describes the desire, love, and devotion that she feels towards this person. She describes the positive feelings of being in love, while also hinting at the bitter disappointment that occurs when the person you're in love with does not return your feelings.</p>

                                <p>This song uses the motif of eggshells to describe frailty and vulnerability. Mitski relates herself to Humpty Dumpty, the English folktale character, who fell from a wall and broke apart. </p>

                                <p>This song describes the feeling of being in a one-sided relationship and how one may struggle to try and save the failing relationship. Mitski feels apprehensive about the relationship, but she still wants to salvage what they have because of her love for them. She sings about blindly falling for someone and not being prepared for the tumultuousness of the relationship to come. </p>

                                <p>In this song, Mitski grapples with feeling shame about her body. The crescendos indicate rising feelings of disgust and hopelessness that she relates to her image of her body. This song utilizes string instruments, mostly violin, to give a formal/classical touch to a song that deals with anguish and despair, creating an interesting juxtaposition.</p>
